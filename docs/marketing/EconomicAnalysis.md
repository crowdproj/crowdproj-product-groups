# Economic analysis 

## Total market size 

In 2021 year the global SaaS market size reached 145$ billion, which is a third more than year earlier. This means that 
in 2020 the growth rate of spending on software as service was significantly higher(+78%) compared to the previous year. 
The data was provided by analysts from Paddle, a company that offers an infrastructure payment system for SaaS projects
in March 2022.

Experts attribute the significant slowdown in the growth dynamics of the global SaaS solutions market to the weakening 
influence of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic factor, which in 2020 pushed companies towards mass transition to remote 
work (causing a significant increase in demand for cloud-based tools). 
Vendors become adapting to the changed situation by offering new tools and price models, as well as focusing on the 
capabilities of their products.
